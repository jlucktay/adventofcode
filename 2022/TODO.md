# TODO

- [x] apply error handling pattern to all `main`/`cmd`s
- [ ] check for all ignored errors and underscores
  - [x] day 2
    - [x] rune errors
    - [x] checking split strings
- [ ] DRY
  - [x] day 2 scaffolding can be deduped
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] day 7 should keep directory entries in order; currently the expected test output for part 1 has been massaged
    because `prettyPrint()` sorts entries alphabetically when displaying them
